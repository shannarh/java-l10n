# Java Localization demo

![CI build status badge](https://github.com/cletusw/java-l10n/workflows/Java%20build/badge.svg)

Double click `win-run.bat` (Windows) or `mac-linux-run.sh` (Mac/Linux) to build and run the demo. Note that, by default, Mac OS disallows running scripts in this way. As a workaround, follow [these steps](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/322693/112177) to manually open the script with the Terminal app.

Code is located in [app > src > main](app/src/main).

If something's broken or you get errors about files in use, open the `scripts` folder, double click `win-clean.bat` (Windows) or `mac-linux-clean.sh` (Mac/Linux), then try again.
